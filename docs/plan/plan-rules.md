# Plan System — Rules

Working rules for the `docs/plan/` session management system. These exist so any AI session can pick up cleanly without losing context or making inconsistent decisions.

---

## The System

```
docs/plan/
├── plan-rules.md               This file — read first
├── tasklist.md                 Canonical task register (all tasks, open + completed)
├── handoff_YYYY-MM-DD.md       Latest session handoff — updated at session end
└── archive/                    Historic handoffs — moved here when no longer active
```

---

## Rule 1 — Always write a handoff at session end

Before the session ends (or before context compaction), write `handoff_YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

Use today's date. If a handoff already exists for today, append a session letter: `handoff_YYYY-MM-DD_b.md`.

**Minimum handoff content:**
- What was accomplished (files changed, decisions made)
- Current state (what works, what doesn't)
- Open tasks (which are unblocked, which are blocked and why)
- Any open questions (mark OPEN — never silently assume)
- Next session recommendation with entry prompt

**Never:** Leave session state only in the chat context. It will be lost.

---

## Rule 2 — All tasks go in tasklist.md

`tasklist.md` is the canonical task register. Every task — open or completed — lives here.

- Open tasks: ⚠️ TODO
- Untested / in progress: 🔲 Untested
- Completed tasks: ✅ Done YYYY-MM-DD
- Blocked tasks: ⛔ Blocked (reason + what unblocks it)
- Abandoned tasks: ~~Struck through~~ with reason

**Never delete completed tasks.** The history is the record.

Tasks are grouped by type. Adapt these to your project — common types:

| Type | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **FEAT** | New feature or page |
| **FIX** | Bug fix |
| **STYLE** | CSS-only changes |
| **HTML** | HTML markup changes |
| **DOCS** | Documentation updates only |
| **PERF** | Performance improvements |
| **A11Y** | Accessibility fixes |
| **SEO** | SEO improvements |
| **DEPLOY** | Hosting, CI, DNS, domain changes |
| **USER** | Manual browser testing, audits — no code changes |

---

## Rule 3 — Mark OPEN, not ASSUMED

If a question arises mid-session and cannot be definitively answered, write it explicitly:

```
OPEN: Does the form validation handle empty strings correctly?
ASSUMED: Yes, based on the empty-check logic — needs browser confirmation.
```

Never silently resolve open questions by assuming. If an assumption is wrong, the next session inherits a bug.

---

## Rule 4 — Archive old handoffs

When a sprint closes (major milestone: feature complete, audit done, significant refactor), move all but the most recent handoff to `docs/plan/archive/`. Keep the latest handoff active for next-session pickup.

---

## Rule 5 — Context degradation recovery

If context has clearly degraded (AI references old state, gives contradictory answers, forgets constraints):

1. Write `recovery_YYYY-MM-DD.md` immediately — capture current state of all open tasks
2. Tell the user what may have been lost
3. Recommend a fresh session with this handoff as the entry point

---

## Rule 6 — Write checkpoint after every significant code change

Do not wait until session end to write state. After any Write or Edit to a source file, append a mini-checkpoint to the active `handoff_[date].md`.

**Mini-checkpoint format:**
```
### Checkpoint [HH:MM]
**Changed:** `[filename]`
**What:** [one sentence]
**Why:** [one sentence — problem solved]
**Regression check:** [Pass / OPEN: concern]
**Next:** [next step or BLOCKED: reason]
```

Additional auto-triggers (see `docs/architecture/CHECKPOINTS.md` for full table):
- After a second-model consultation → note the finding in the handoff
- After a root cause is identified → write it before proposing the fix
- After a browser test result → update `tasklist.md` task status
- After a new architectural decision → add ADR to `docs/architecture/DECISIONS.md`
- When context is approaching full → write `recovery_[date].md` and notify user

---

## Rule 7 — Choose the right session style

| Style | When | Trigger |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Engineered Hybrid** *(default)* | Day-to-day dev, feature work, bug fixing | Read handoff + ARCHITECTURE.md + CORE_PATTERNS.md |
| **Fresh (Red Team)** | Architecture decisions, new feature design, avoiding tunnel vision | New session, ARCHITECTURE.md + task description only — no handoff |
| **Deep (Bloated)** | Mystery bugs, >2 failed attempts, "why is this failing?" | Load handoff + ARCHITECTURE_EXTENSION.md + browser console output |

**Use Hybrid unless the task explicitly requires Fresh or Deep.**

---

## Entry Prompts for New Sessions

**Engineered Hybrid (default):**
```
Read docs/plan/handoff_[latest].md, docs/plan/tasklist.md, and docs/ARCHITECTURE.md.
The task is: [task description].
```

**Fresh (Red Team):**
```
Read docs/ARCHITECTURE.md and docs/architecture/CORE_PATTERNS.md. The task is: [task description].
Do not read any handoffs or session history. Approach this as if you have never seen this code before.
```

**Deep (Bloated):**
```
Read docs/plan/handoff_[latest].md, docs/plan/tasklist.md, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md,
docs/architecture/CORE_PATTERNS.md, and docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_EXTENSION.md.
The issue is: [bug description]. Include browser console output below.
```
